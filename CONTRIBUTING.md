# Contributing

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in contributing! Please take a moment to
review the following:

## Style Guide

- **Commits** follow the
  ["Conventional Commits" specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  This allows for changelogs to be generated automatically upon release.
- **Code** is formatted via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- **JavaScript** is written as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) where
  possible.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
   and clone to your machine.
2. Create a new branch with your contribution. **Always work on a new branch**.
3. Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
   and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) on your machine.
4. In the repo, install dependencies via:
   ```sh
   pnpm i
   ```
5. Voilà, you're ready to go!

### Scripts

- `pnpm dev` – runs jest, watching for file changes
- `pnpm build` – production build
- `pnpm check` – type checks
- `pnpm test`

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with the
commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of the
following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if
  present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to dependencies
  or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  GitHub actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

  e.g. `feat(components): add new prop to the avatar component`

- Don't forget to run tests and linters before pushing

1. Open a PR
2. Request code review
3. Complete code review with fixes
4. A maintainer will merge the PR, checking commit code and squashing if necessary
5. travis-ci will automatically run semantic-version and publish the new code!

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit

[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

## Releases

A trade-off with using a personal repo is that permissions are fairly locked-down.
In the mean-time releases will be made manually by the project owner.
